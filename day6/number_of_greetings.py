# We want to count the number of times a person has greeted someone. To do this, we'll add another attribute, greeting_count, and initialize it to 0. Then each time the greet method is called, we'll increment greeting_count by 1.

# The output will resemble the following:

# >>> sonny.greeting_count
# 0
# >>> sonny.greet(jordan)
# >>> sonny.greeting_count
# 1
# >>> sonny.greet(jordan)
# >>> sonny.greeting_count
# 2
