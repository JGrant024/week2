# is_even function
# Write a function that accepts a number as an argument and returns a Boolean value. Return True if the number is even; return False if it is not even.

# is_odd function
# Write an is_odd function that uses your is_even function to determine if a number is odd. (That is, do not do the calculation - call a function that does the calculation.)

# Hint: You'll use the not keyword.

# only_evens function
# Write a function that accepts a List of numbers as an argument.

# Return a new List that includes the only the even numbers.

# only_evens([11, 20, 42, 97, 23, 10])
# # Returns [20, 42, 10]

# Hint: use your is_even() function to determine which numbers to include in your new List.

# only_odds function
# Write a function that accepts a List of numbers as an argument.

# Return a new List that includes the only the odd numbers.

# only_odds([11, 20, 42, 97, 23, 10])
# # Returns [11, 97, 23]

# Hint: use your is_odd() function to determine which numbers to include in your new List.
