# Make a string with at least 6 characters.
# Make an empty list (hint: create a variable with no value between the brackets)
# Loop through each letter in your string and for each letter in the string, append it to the empty list.
# Revese the list.
# Create a new variable that is an empty string (just like in JavaScript).
# Loop through the list, for each letter in the list, add it to the new string your created.
# Print out the new string. It should be the reversed version of the string you created. i.e. "sean" -> "neas".
